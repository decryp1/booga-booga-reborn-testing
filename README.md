This is a Lua script written for Roblox, specifically a game called "Booga Booga Reborn." Itâ€™s a custom GUI (Graphical User Interface) script called "Herkle Hub," designed to provide players with various cheats, automation features, and quality-of-life enhancements. The script uses a library called "Fluent" to create a user-friendly interface with tabs, toggles, sliders, buttons, and dropdowns, allowing you to tweak settings and activate features in-game.

### What Does It Do?
The script offers a range of features organized into tabs:
- **Main**: Adjust walkspeed, jump power, hip height, and toggle "no mountain slip."
- **Combat**: Enable a "kill aura" to automatically attack nearby players.
- **Map**: Automate resource gathering (e.g., trees, rocks) and critter hunting.
- **Pickup**: Automatically pick up items or items from chests, with customizable item filters.
- **Farming**: Automate planting and harvesting crops in "Plant Boxes."
- **Extra**: Features like orbiting items around your character and loading additional scripts (e.g., Infinite Yield).
- **Settings**: Save and load your configurations.

These features are typical of Roblox exploits, giving players an advantage by automating tasks or enhancing character abilities beyond normal gameplay limits.

### How to Use It
To use this script, youâ€™ll need a Roblox exploit executor (e.g., Synapse X, Krnl, Fluxus, or another compatible tool). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Get an Exploit Executor**:
   - Download and install a Roblox exploit executor. Ensure itâ€™s from a trusted source to avoid malware.
   - Popular free options include Krnl or Fluxus, though paid ones like Synapse X offer more reliability.

2. **Join Booga Booga Reborn**:
   - Open Roblox and join the "Booga Booga Reborn" game.

3. **Open the Executor**:
   - Launch your exploit executor while in the game.

4. **Inject the Script**:
   - Copy the entire script you provided.
   - Paste it into the executorâ€™s script input area.
   - Press the "Execute" or "Inject" button (the exact label depends on your executor).

5. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Once executed, a window titled "Herkle Hub -- Booga Booga Reborn" should appear on your screen.
   - Use your mouse to navigate the tabs (Main, Combat, Map, etc.).
   - Toggle features on/off, adjust sliders, select items from dropdowns, or click buttons to activate functions.

6. **Customize Settings**:
   - For example:
     - In the **Main** tab, enable "Walkspeed," then slide the "Value" to increase your speed.
     - In the **Combat** tab, turn on "Kill Aura" to auto-attack players within a set range.
     - In the **Pickup** tab, select items like "Gold" or "Log" to auto-collect them.
   - Changes apply in real-time as you tweak the options.

7. **Minimize the GUI**:
   - Press **Left Control** (default key) to hide/show the window.

8. **Save Your Settings**:
   - Go to the **Settings** tab to save your configuration so it reloads next time.

### Notes
- **Requirements**: This script relies on Robloxâ€™s Lua environment and the Fluent library, which it downloads from GitHub during execution. Your executor must support HTTP requests (`game:HttpGetAsync`).
- **Risks**: Using exploits violates Robloxâ€™s Terms of Service and can lead to bans. Use at your own risk, ideally on an alternate account.
- **Errors**: If the script doesnâ€™t work, ensure your executor is up-to-date, the game hasnâ€™t patched the exploit methods, or the GitHub links are still active.

### Example Usage
Letâ€™s say you want to farm resources automatically:
1. Inject the script.
2. Open the "Map" tab.
3. Toggle "Resource Aura" on.
4. Adjust the "Range" slider to 15 and "Max Targets" to 3.
5. Watch as your character automatically swings at nearby resources (e.g., trees, rocks) within 15 studs.
